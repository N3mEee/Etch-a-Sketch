# Etch-a-Sketch

This is my solution for The Odin Project's [Etch-a-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project) assignment. I used HTML, CSS and JS to create a web version of the classic drawing toy.

## Live Demo

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

-   Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/N3mEee/Etch-a-Sketch.git`

## Usage

To draw on the screen, use your mouse or touchpad to hover over the grid cells.
You can change the color of your drawing by clicking on the color input button
You can also erase your drawing by clicking on the clear button.
To change the size of the grid, click on custom and enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input box.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank The Odin Project for providing this fun and challenging assignment. I learned how to use DOM manipulation with JS and how to create responsive layouts with CSS grid.

I also used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urwzk6ILvPQ) by Web Dev Simplified as a reference for some of the JS logic.
